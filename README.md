# Digital Audit Techniques: Analysing Financial Records for Journal Entry Testing and Anomaly Detection

This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Evidence based Decisions using Big Data Analytics during the exchange at Technische Universität München as part of the Master’s degree program in Finance at Luiss Guido Carli University.

This project applies digital audit techniques to synthetic datasets simulating real-world financial records to assess the integrity of financial statements. The analysis includes detecting anomalies through weekend entry checks, cash-minus inspections, duplicate identification, and statistical distribution testing based on Benford’s Law.
